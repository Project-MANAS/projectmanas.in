					<li>Snacks</li>
				</h3>
				<p>
					There's no one in the workshop who loves snacks as much as Anish. One day however, the juniors under
					the guidance of Dhruv decided to steal his snacks and scatter them all over in the hockey ground.
					Anish was angry at first, as he didn't want to go in search of his snacks midday, so he had an idea.
					He decided to use a drone to retrieve the snacks. He needs your help to find the best way to
					retrieve dem snacks! In order to find out where they are located in the field, he takes the drone
					really high up and lets your algorithm do its job. The algorithm first detects where all the snacks
					are located in the map, which Anish has already implemented. Now he wants you to find path to follow
					with which he can retrive those snacks. Mind you, there are obstacles in the ground into which you
					don't want to crash into! Be sure to retrieve all the snacks as any snacks you leave out will be
					devoured by Dhruv :)
				</p>

				<h3 class="">
					<li>Snacks (Hard)</li>
				</h3>

				<p>
					Anish is happy with your Algorithm, but the drone is limited in terms of its battery power and
					dynamics. Hence he wants you to find the best order to retrieve the snacks so that the path is
					really short as well as smooth.

					Garima loves to play air hockey and hates to lose, so much so that she decides to build a robot
					that can play with multiple people! But before it can play with others, it must be able to play
					with the table! Garima made her own custom table to train her robot. Help Garima build this
					robot and conquer the world of air hockey!
					<br>
					Given dimensions of the room, an image of the room (table space consists of 1's, the puck must
					remain in this space), and starting two points of the puck before the first reflection in (x,y)
					format, give the next 'k' points of contact of the puck with the table.

					Sensing And Automation
				</h2>
				<p>
					The challenges for Sensing and Automation recruitments give you the opportunity to skip the

					phase. Solve the questions below to grab the opportunity.
					Deadline is 10th September.
				</p>
				<h3 class="">
					<li>Hardware and PCB Designing Challenge</li>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Design a Buck Converter Circuit with LM2596 IC (use datasheet for reference)and the following
					specifications:
				</p>
				<!-- <p>
					For eg if the INPUT button is pressed 2 times then the LED array will show 0000, 0001, 0010 and reverse to 0 until the <b>RESET</b>
					button is pressed.
				</p> -->
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p> Input Voltage: 18V to 25.2V </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> Output Voltage: 5V </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> Max Output Current: 3A </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> Appropriate connectors for I/O </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> Suitable protection features as applicable </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Design a single layer PCB along with schematic using Autodesk Eagle.</p>

				<h5><span class="orange">Judging Criteria</span></h5>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p> Efficiency of the Circuit and PCB </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> Appropriate Component Selection (price and availability) </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> Minimum size of PCB </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h5><span class="orange">Bonus Task</span></h5>
				<p>Additionally, you can simulate the above designed circuit in any simulation software, it is optional,
					but extra points would be awarded.</p>

				<br>

				<h3 class="">
					<li>Embedded Systems Challenge</li>
				</h3>

				<p>You have 7 pushbuttons, 1 potentiometer (250 ohms), 4 <b>LEDs</b>, 1 microcontroller.</p>
				<p>Arrange the above components and simulate a circuit wherein:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Pushbuttons 1-4 represent <b>TOGGLE</b> buttons</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Pushbutton 5 represents <b>ALL_ON</b> button</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Pushbutton 6 represents <b>ALL_OFF</b> button</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Pushbutton 7 represents <b>MODE</b> button</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Pushbutton 8 represents <b>RESET</b> button</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					The number of times the <b>MODE</b> button is pressed is the mode of operation. For example, if the
					<b>MODE</b> button is pressed twice, the mode should be set as 2. Once the mode is set, the circuit
					should execute the desired functions.
				</p>

				<p>
					The press of the <b>RESET</b> button should reset the entire system (while possibly still in
					operation), allowing the user to input the mode again.
				</p>

				<p>
					There are 3 modes to be developed:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><span class="orange">Toggle:</span> In this mode, the press of any of the <b>TOGGLE</b>
							buttons should cause a corresponding <b>LED</b> to start glowing, maintaining its state.
							When a second <b>TOGGLE</b> button is pressed, the corresponding <b>LED</b> to that button
							should start glowing along with the previous <b>LED</b>. If a <b>TOGGLE</b> button to an
							already lit <b>LED</b> is pressed, the corresponding <b>LED</b> should stop glowing, leaving
							the state of the other <b>LEDs</b> unchanged. Please note that when an <b>LED</b> is made to
							glow, it should stay glowing till its state is toggled. The press of the <b>ALL_ON</b>
							button should cause all the <b>LEDs</b> to glow, and the press of the <b>ALL_OFF</b> button
							should cause all <b>LEDs</b> to stop glowing.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><span class="orange">Pulse:</span> In this mode, all the <b>LEDs</b> must pulsate (start
							glowing and stop glowing in a cycle) with a frequency based on the input from the
							potentiometer. Turning the potentiometer clockwise should increase the frequency, turning it
							anticlockwise should decrease it. Pushing of any pushbuttons 1-7 should not affect the pulse
							executed in this mode.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><span class="orange">Memory:</span> In this mode, the <b>LEDs</b> must glow in the order
							decided by the sequence with which the pushbuttons are pressed. For example, take the
							following sequence:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>1 &rArr; 3 &rArr; 1 &rArr; <b>ALL_ON</b></p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					After taking any such sequence as input, the pressing of the <b>ALL_OFF</b> button should cause the
					<b>LEDs</b> to glow in the same sequence, with the speed of change to the next state being decided
					by the input from the potentiometer, similar to <span class="orange">Pulse</span> mode.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="orange">Hints:</span> Use of arrays may help design the above system. The use of
					Arduino is preferred for this question. Simulating is easy on Tinkercad. Name all variables in the
					code appropriately for more readability and easy debugging.
				</p>


				<br>
				<h3 class="">
					<li>Planning and Control System Challenges</li>
				</h3>
				<p>
					You are building an intelligent robotic spy to spy on an alleged criminal. The robot spy is equipped
					with many sensors utilizing which it would relay important information regarding the alleged to you.
					The base of the robot is a 2-wheeled differential drive robot with 5 ultrasonic sensors arranged as
					shown.

				<h4><span class="orange">LEVEL-1 TASK</span></h4>
				<p>Design an approach and write code to program the robot to follow the suspect in a bounded unknown
					environment with only rectangular obstacles. The robot must also avoid the obstacles as it tries to
					follow the target. The constraint is to stay close to the target but not too close to avoid getting
					caught. The ideal radius to spy on is between 1m to 2m.</p>
				<h5><span class="orange">Assumptions:</span></h5>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Assume that you receive the position of the target from the command center in the form of
							(x, y) coordinates w.r.t the bottom left of the bounded field which is to be considered the
							origin I.e., (0, 0).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Also assume that you know your global position (x,y,theta) in the field (w.r.t the origin)
							from an in-built positioning system.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Robot always starts from origin(0,0,0).
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4><span class="orange">LEVEL-2 TASK</span></h4>
				<p>The robotic spy was working according to the expectations but now the in-built positioning system has
					failed, now you can’t expect the robot to know its current position(x,y,theta).</p>
				<p>Modify the approach in order to make this system work satisfactorily. The assumption that robot
					always starts from origin still holds.</p>

				<p>An example environment is given below with the differential drive robot</p>

				<p><span class="orange"> Hint:</span> How would the robot be able to keep track of its position?</p>

				<h5><span class="orange">Judging Criteria</span></h5>
				<p> The approach to solve the problem would be given more importance. An abstract (but detailed) code to
					solve the problem would suffice (Programming language of your choice).</p>

					A shaft rotates clockwise constantly at 1200 rpm. Design a mechanism that converts this motion of
					the shaft to an oscillating linear motion of a bar. The bar should move forward 10cm and then come
					backward by 10 cm to its original position. This cycle of forward and backward movement of the bar
					should happen every one minute, i.e. once the bar is back to its original position it will stop for
					one minute, then go forward and backward, then stop for one minute and so on.

					Design a payload dropping mechanism for an aircraft from an altitude of 30m without any power
					consumption from the batteries. The dimensions of the payload are 300*150*100mm and mass 2kg. The
					dimensions of the fuselage are 1000*200*250mm. The payload rests inside the fuselage initially and
