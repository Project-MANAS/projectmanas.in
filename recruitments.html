					<li>Don’t cry over Fallen Presents (easy)</li>
				</h3>
				<p>
					It’s Christmas time and Project MANAS is getting ready to open their presents. Unfortunately,
					Shivansh is a bit clumsy
					and falls over the presents by mistake. The presents are actually gift hampers so their contents get
					spread on the floor
					by mistake. Thankfully, the damage is not much and one can understand which item belongs to which
					hamper. In addition to
					being clumsy, Shivansh is very lazy so he wants you to do that. You are given the floor dimensions
					and the number of
					presents and your goal is to identify the centre of the fallen items of each present. The fallen
					items are represented
					as 1s and the empty spots as 0s. Output the centers.<br>
					<b>Note:</b> Make sure to handle the input in the same order as given. (consider the bottom left as
					the origin)

				</p>

				<h3 class="">
					<li>Don’t cry over fallen presents(Hard)</li>
				</h3>

				<p>
					(Extension of the easy part) Everything was going fine for Shivansh but then Anshumaan came into the
					room and saw the
					fallen presents. As a physics lover, he wanted to understand the different patterns and boundaries
					of the fallen items
					for his upcoming paper on entropy. He wants you to give information about the boundaries of each
					fallen gift. Do this by
					returning the coordinates of the points that are located exactly on the boundary.<br>

					<b>Note:</b> Please ensure that the enclosing polygon is convex. The points on the said polygon need
					to be
					coordinates of the
					boundary items for that hamper.

				</p>
				<br>
				<h3 class="">
					<li>Need for Speed : Eve Wanted (Easy)</li>
				</h3>
				<p>
					It’s time for Project MANAS to upgrade their PC parts but unfortunately they cannot be shipped to
					us. AI members Ishika
					and Aryan decide that they would drive down to the seller and collect it themselves. Since both of
					them do not have a
					driving licence it’s up to EVE, our self driving car to take them to their destined location.
					Your mission, should you choose to accept it, would be to write a vector based navigation solution
					that avoids all
					obstacles on their way to the store.
					Due to the extremely short battery life of EVE and the fact that Ishika was too lazy to fully charge
					it, ensure that
					navigation output is the shortest possible path.
					EVE uses a PID controller to navigate which relies on a heading angle and position to correct the
					path. Therefore, the
					objective is to output the position and heading angle of EVE at points along your generated path at
					intervals of a fixed
					magnitude.
				</p>
				<div class="note">
					<p> Note that you will be penalised for vectors that enter obstacle zones as well as for
						discontinuous paths.

							<li>Need for Speed: Eve Wanted (Hard)</li>
						</h3>
					</h4>
					<p>
						There's a small problem: most shops are closed today because of a festival. There is one PC shop
						in Manipal that is
						open, but it's located in an area by the beach with sandy soil, rocky terrain, and a lot of
						puddles. Time for EVE, our
						self-driving car, to go off-road!

						In this question, each obstacle has a predefined traversability value (or 'cost') between 1 and
						10. For example, shallow
						puddles can quite easily be passed (they have low cost = 1), sand is more difficult but still
						traversable, while rocks
						are impossible to pass through (with the highest cost = 10). Since EVE has sensitive electronic
						components, driving over
						difficult obstacles can cause a lot of damage to our club's hard work (and yearly budget).

						Avoiding all obstacles which are impossible to pass through (with cost = 10), find an optimum
						path that causes least
						damage to EVE. Don't forget that EVE also has low charge, so a very long path is not a great
						idea!

					Sensing And Automation
				</h2>
				<p>
					The challenges for Sensing and Automation recruitments give you the opportunity to skip the
					interviews and get into the task
					phase. Solve the questions below to grab the opportunity.
					The deadline is 9th December.

					<li>Hardware and PCB Designing Challenge</li>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Since Christmas is near, Darshan wants his house to be decorated with twinkle lights. But right
					before he can place an
					order on Amazon, his brother, Vishal, gets hold of him and puts forth a challenge. If he can build
					him a circuit that
					can flash at least two LEDs, he’ll buy as many lights as Darshan wishes. Of course, the real gift is
					for Darshan to
					understand and appreciate how the beautiful patterns that he loves are brought to life.

				</p>
				<h5><u>Easy</u></h5>
				<p>
					The task is to design a simple voltage regulator.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using an LM317 voltage regulator IC, design a PCB capable of supplying voltages between 1.25-27 V at
					1.5A. Use the
					datasheet for reference. Check below for specifications.
					<br>
					A wheel of mass 4Kg and radius 2m is rotating about x axis with an angular momentum of
					5kgm<sup>2</sup>/s. If now it is rotated about the Z-axis by an angle of 30&deg; in 2 sec, calculate
					the direction and magnitude of the new angular momentum. Assume thickness of wheel is negligible.
					<br>
					Include:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p> Appropriate Resistors for minimum power loss.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> Appropriate connectors on the Input and Output sides.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> Suitable protection features.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Design a single layer PCB along with schematic using Autodesk Eagle.</p>

				<h5><u>Hard</u></h5>
				<p>
					The task is to understand and implement the 555 timer IC.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the help of a 555 timer IC, design a circuit drawing power from the voltage regulator in the
					previous task that
					flashes two generic LEDs alternatively such that Ton = Toff, this frequency should be adjustable.
					<br>
					A wheel of mass 4Kg and radius 2m is rotating about x axis with an angular momentum of

						<li>Embedded Systems Challenge 2</li>
					</h3>

					<p>Two friends Aditya and Sitaraman, were really into building drones. Their obsession with drones
						developed a compulsive
						need to understand everything there is to know about drones. One fine day, they were flying the
						drone, but it lost
						control and went somewhere unknown. They loved their drone and wanted it back, at any cost.

					</p>
					<p>They started looking at the log output of the GPS; it seemed to be in a weird format that they
						did
						not understand.
						Aditya and Sitaraman are very sad and can’t think straight. They are asking you for help to make
						sense of this data so
						they can locate the drone.

					</p>
					<p>They are C fanatics and want you to write a custom parser for this data stream, using C only, and
						export it into a CSV
						file. They then want you to plot the coordinates on google maps/earth to visualize the data.
						Using
						an external library
						for the parser is not permitted. You must use only standard C libraries. You may use any
						language/library for plotting
						the coordinates.

					</p>

					<p>
						Submission of the C file that parses the data and exports a CSVs along with a document
						explaining
						how it works is
						compulsory; visualization of the points will fetch you extra marks.

					<p>
						Tushar and Dhruva have built a 4-wheel differential-drive robot (Skid-steer drive specifically).
						They made it a hobby
						project but are now occupied with research work on FPGAs. It is now up to you to configure the
						robot
						and complete the
						field tests.
						The robot contains an IR temperature sensor on the bottom of its body, pointing to the ground
						and
						giving you the floor’s
						temperature below it. An inbuilt positioning system gives you Odometry, including position and
						angular orientation(x, y,
						z, θ) at any point in time.

					<h4><span class="orange">LEVEL-1 TASK</span></h4>
					<p>The first task is to find the hottest and coldest points in the field (both unique) and then
						travel
						from origin to the
						hottest point, followed by the coldest point followed by the point whose temperature is equal to
						the
						average of hottest
						and coldest temperatures (take the closest smaller integer if the values don’t match). Every
						time
						you reach one of these
						points, the robot stops and deploys a sensor to monitor temperature for Tushar continuously.
						Design an approach and write pseudocode to complete this task and explain how you can interpret
						the
						grid system from the
						real world.</p>

					<h5><span class="orange">Assumptions:</span></h5>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								Assume that you receive the position of the target from the command center in the form
								of (x, y) coordinates w.r.t the bottom left of the bounded field which is to be
								considered
								the origin I.e., (0, 0) in meters every timestep.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Also assume that you know your global position (x,y,theta) in the field (w.r.t the
								origin)
								from an in-built positioning system.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Robot always starts from origin(0,0,0).
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Max speed of the robot: 5 m/s
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Expected Output: You must output the control commands i.e., speeds of the left and right wheels
						of the bot in m/s every timestep.</p>

					<h4><span class="orange">LEVEL-2 TASK</span></h4>
					<p>After finishing the first task, there were heavy rains, and our positioning system failed to work
						due
						to the bad
						weather, and the deployed sensors need to be collected as they are malfunctioning. You have
						reached
						the origin after the
						first task and now need to travel by treating the sensors as obstacles. Choose appropriate
						sensors
						before starting out
						to be able to detect the obstacles.
					</p>
					<p>You can add a maximum of 3 more sensors of a maximum of 2 different types of your choice to
						customize
						your robot
						further. Design an approach and write pseudocode to complete this task and provide supporting
						arguments for the choice of
						sensors.</p>

					<p>Modify the approach in order to make this system work satisfactorily. The assumption that robot
						always starts from origin still holds.</p>
					<p>Expected Output: Same as Level 1.</p>
					<p><span class="orange">Expected answers:</span> A simple pseudo-code in any language will suffice.
						Along with this, you will need to provide the velocities of each pair
						of wheels throughout the process with equations. You can also provide some text describing what
						you
						are trying to do in
						the pseudo-code.</p>

				<p>
					The mechanical challenge is a bonus round for you to skip the whole interview phase and directly get
					in the task phase. The
					challenge is divided into two parts, Mechanics and Design challenge. As a second year it is
					compulsory to attempt both. The challenge is meant to test your innovative skill as well
					as your mathematical foundation. The deadline is 9th December.

					You are playing a video game and to complete the level you must cross a rotating disc with angular
					speed = 5 rad/sec and
					radius = 10m. The character spawned at Point A at the center of the disc and you must reach point B
					in a straight radial
					path. The character can move with a constant speed Sm.

				<ul>
					<li>
						What should be the minimum speed (Smin) so you can traverse the disk in a straight line from
						Point
						A to B wrt ground.
					</li>
					<li>
						Find the time needed to traverse from A to B,radial distance as a function of time,radial
						velocity
						as a function of
						time & radial acceleration as a function of time for speed Smin.
					</li>
					<li>
						What will happen if his walking speed is less than Smin. and why?

					An elastic string of natural length √2 L m has one end, A, fixed and the other, B, attached to one
					end of a uniform rod
					BC of length L m and mass M. This can turn freely in a vertical plane about its other end C, which
					is fixed at a
					distance L m vertically below A. Initially the rod is vertical, and, on being slightly displaced,
					falls until it is
					horizontal (extension in the string is small), and then rises again to AC. Find the elastic constant
					(k) of string.

				</h3>
				<h5><u>EASY</u></h5>
				<p>
					A car washing centre wants to build a synchronously sliding door. You are provided with one motor
					which rotates
					clockwise at 800 rpm and changes its direction of rotation every 15 seconds. The doors open up to 3m
					(1.5m each side) in
					a synchronous manner. Build a mechanism to achieve this motion.

				</p>
				<h5><u>MEDIUM</u></h5>
				<p>
					A mechanism feeds Aluminium cans at a constant feed rate (1 can/second). Design a 3-jaw gripper
					mechanism that grips &
					crushes cans and drops and so on. You have only been given one rotating shaft to actuate the gripper
					which rotates at
					120 rpm. (You need not concern yourself with the feeding mechanism, only design the gripper
					mechanism)

				</p>
				<h5><u>HARD</u></h5>
				<p>
					You got a job of automation in a storage facility and you need to place boxes at their desired
					positions in a row at
					‘1m’ height, the boxes are picked up vertically and need to be placed horizontally. Bad news, your
					boss hates you and
					gave you a pneumatic to actuate this procedure which can only tilt from the vertical by 60 degrees.
					The max pressure the
					pneumatic can achieve is P=5Pa, Area of Cross Section, A = 5000 cm^2 and work the actuator can do
					W=8x10^5 dyne.m (Don’t
					concern yourself with gripping the boxes, your annoying boss took credit for designing that.).
